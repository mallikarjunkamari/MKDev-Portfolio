To add your resume download functionality:

## Step 1: Create Your Resume PDF
Create a professional resume PDF with the following sections:
- Contact Information
- Professional Summary
- Work Experience (with dates, companies, roles)
- Education
- Technical Skills
- Key Projects
- Certifications
- Awards/Recognition (if applicable)

## Step 2: Save the Resume
- Save your resume as `resume.pdf`
- Place it in the `assets/` folder
- Ensure the file size is optimized (< 2MB recommended)

## Step 3: Verify Download
- Visit the Experience page
- Click the "Download Resume" button
- The PDF should download automatically

## Resume Tips
- Use a clean, professional layout
- Include relevant keywords for Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS)
- Use standard fonts (Arial, Calibri, Times New Roman)
- Keep it to 1-2 pages
- Proofread carefully

The download button is already implemented in `experience.html` and will work once you add your `resume.pdf` file.
